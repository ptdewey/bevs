### Recipe

- 2oz gin
- 2oz+ tonic water (to taste)
- Splash of lime juice
- Garnish with lime wedge
- Serve over ice in a rocks glass

### Recommendations

The amount of tonic water should be adjusted to your preferences, from anywhere between a 1:1 to 1:3 ratio of gin to tonic.
I generally use a 1:1.75 ratio, or 3.5oz of tonic water.

My favorite variant of this drink is the Bramble and Tonic, made with Bombay Bramble, as I feel the blackberry and raspberry flavors are a great fit for the drink.
