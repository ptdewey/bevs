### Recipe

- 2oz gin
- 4-8oz ginger ale
- (Optional) Garnish with lemon wedge
- Serve over ice in a highball glass

### Recommendations

My favorite version of this drink is made with specifically Bombay Sapphire gin, and Vernors ginger ale. I generally use around 8oz of Vernors and don't add a lemon garnish.
